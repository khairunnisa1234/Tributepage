        <ul class = "py-4"></ul>
            <p>Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened to Narendra or Naren)in a Bengali family in his ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta</p>

            <p>His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court. Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar who left his family and became a monk at age twenty-five. His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife.</p>

            <p>Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to meditate before the images of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman.</p>

        <ul class = "py-4"></ul>
        <p>In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877.In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination.  He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and literature.</p>

        <p> In 1881, he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884. Narendra studied the works of David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, Georg W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin. He became fascinated with the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer and corresponded with him,translating Herbert Spencer's book Education (1861) into Bengali. While studying Western philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and Bengali literature.</p>

        <ul class ="py-4"></ul>
        <p>In 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a Parivrâjaka— the Hindu religious life of a wandering monk, "without fixed abode, without ties, independent and strangers wherever they go".</p>
        
        <p>His sole possessions were a kamandalu , staff and his two favourite books: the Bhagavad Gita and The Imitation of Christ.Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns.</p>

        <p>He developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift the nation.Living primarily on bhiksha (alms), Narendra travelled on foot and by railway (with tickets bought by admirers). During his travels he met, and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: scholars, dewans, rajas, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, paraiyars (low-caste workers) and government officials.</p>

        <p>On 31 May 1893, Narendra left Bombay for Chicago with the name, as suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri, "Vivekananda"–a conglomerate of the Sanskrit words: viveka and ānanda, meaning "the bliss of discerning wisdom".</p>

        <ul class ="py-4"></ul>
        <p>Vivekananda started his journey to the West on 31 May 1893 and visited several cities in Japan (including Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama, Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo),China and Canada en route to the United States,reaching Chicago on 30 July 1893,
            where the "Parliament of Religions" took place in September 1893.The Congress was an initiative of the Swedenborgian layman, and judge of the Illinois Supreme Court,
            Charles C. Bonney, to gather all the religions of the world, and show "the substantial unity of many religions in the good deeds of the religious life."
            It was one of the more than 200 adjunct gatherings and congresses of the Chicago's World's Fair, and was "an avant-garde intellectual manifestation of [...] cultic milieus, East and West,"
            with the Brahmo Samaj and the Theosophical Society being invited as representative of Hinduism.</p>
